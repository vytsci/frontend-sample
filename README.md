#Frontend Sample

This is very basic sample for frontend developers

##Install commands

* npm install --dev

##Useful commands

* ./node_modules/.bin/gulp
* ./node_modules/.bin/gulp dependencies
* ./node_modules/.bin/gulp js
* ./node_modules/.bin/gulp css

##Notes

* We keep JS dependencies separate because developers would have proper control over them via CMS
* Keep modular structure as much as possible this will allow to load the most necessary code rather than everything in one file

## Support
Please report any issues straight into GitHub issues section of this repository
